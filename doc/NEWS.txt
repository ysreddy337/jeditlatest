* Folding and narrowing

The folding feature allows lines to be hidden or shown, depending on
their indent level. Since most programming languages use indentation to
nest code, folding away lines with a lot of indent has the effect of
displaying an "overview" of the buffer only, while displaying higher
indent levels "zooms in" on the code and shows more "detail".

A related feature is narrowing; narrowing hides all parts of the buffer
except for a specified range.

Text hidden by folding and narrowing is still present in the buffer, and
can be made visible again using the appropriate commands. Cursor
movement commands skip over the hidden text, but text manipulation
commands act on it.

* Macro improvements

The user's guide now has a large and detailed section and writing
macros. A large collection of sample macros is now included. jEdit now
checks if a macro named 'Startup' exists, and if so, runs it at startup.

* Search and replace improvements

Reverse search is now supported, currently only for literal strings.
Reverse regular expression searching will be added in a future release.

jEdit now includes version 1.1.2 of the gnu.regexp regular expression
package. This version adds a number of new features, such as support for
word boundary (\b, \B) and word anchor (\<, \>) tokens. It also fixes
bugs and improves performance.

* Improved undo

Previously, entering text had to be undone character-by-character. Now,
consecutive insertions can be undone in one operation. Edits performed
by macros are also now batched into one undo.

* File permissions on Unix

jEdit now preserves file permissions when running on Unix. This does not
use any native code and should work on most Unix variants.

* Shortcuts

Each command can now have up to two keyboard shortcuts. Built-in and
plugin command shortcuts are now shown in separate option panes in the
Global Options dialog box. The option panes now support grabbing keys
from the keyboard; this removes the need to memorize the keycode names.

* Abbreviations

Tabs can now be entered in abbreviation expansions. A new abbreviation
editor dialog box is used by the 'Expand Abbreviation' command and
'Abbrevs' option panes. The dialog allows abbreviations to be defined
without having to remember the various escape sequences.

* The mode catalog

Information about all edit modes is now stored in a 'mode catalog' file.
This removes the need to create a 'mode cache' the first time jEdit is
started, which could take a very long time. Note that you must manually
update the catalog if you add your own edit modes.

* Documentation

The help viewer now displays all available documentation, including the
table of contents of the user's guide, in a tree to the left of the help
text for easier navigation.

* Minor changes

- The File->Current Directory menu no longer displays backup and
  autosave files.

- When running on Java 2, all available fonts are now listed in the font
  selector.

- Syntax highlighting added for Ada95, B formal method, BCEL Java
  disassembly, Inform

- Various minor GUI improvements

- jEdit still saves and restores the list of open files, however,
  support for having multiple 'sessions' defined has been moved to the
  BufferList plugin.
