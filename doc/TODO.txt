TO DO

This list is a real mess... Note that not all these changes will be
implemented in jEdit 3.2. Some might appear in a future version, some
might never be implemented at all.

+ search and replace
 - reverse regexp search
 - option for auto wrap around in search
 - search and replace: option to use BeanShell in replace string,
   eg $0.toLowerCase(). That would be rather cool.
 - don't clear hypersearch results between subsequent searches, instead
   have a 'Clear' button in the results window
 - hypersearch: select all found results

+ merge position registers and markers
 - Markers top level menu:
    Add Marker (C+e C+m)
    Add Marker With Shortcut [x] (C+t)
    Go to Marker With Shortcut [x] (C+y)
    Select to Marker With Shortcut [x] (C+u)
    Swap Caret With Marker [x] (C+k)
    Clear Marker (???)
    Clear All Markers
    Go to Previous Marker
    Go to Next Marker
    ----
    <list of markers>

 - each marker's "name" is the line of text (w/o whitespace) containing it.
 - the shortcut is a single key, used by the register-like commands.
 - markers are still persistent, etc.
 - config option for controlling marker persistance

+ editing
 - most recently selected text stored in % register, middle mouse button
    inserts contents of that register
 - magic caret code a bit annoying
 - wing comment with rect sel active puts comment start/end at the
    beginning/end of each selected chunk
 - improved rectangular selections
 - soft wrap
 - discontinuous selection
   - Edit->Discontinuous Selection command
 - cut-append, copy-append, cut-append-register actions
 - Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable

+ folding
 - expand-fold doesn't expand narrowed regions
 - if the first line of the buffer is a collapsed fold: delete, undo,
   text inaccessable until C+e x
 - Perhaps try an alternative implementation of narrowing
 - per-view fold visibility: bit-field used to store this in LineInfo
 - eliminate virtual line map with 'virtualLine' fields in LineInfo
   and binary search in virtualToPhysical()

+ plugins
 - if a plugin is removed and put in a new dir, it is shown in both the
   update and install lists
 - zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
 - display all plugin errors, batched in one window on startup
 - plugin directory should be named 'plugins', not 'jars'
 - move latest version plugin into the core
 - move plugin manager into the core
 - plugin manager: track dependencies, branches

+ syntax highlighting
 - only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php "<?xml ...?>" ?> in PHP)
 - XMode rule inclusion
 - regexps in XMode

+ io
 - can mini io progress, io progress command
 - display io progress automatically after > 1 sec I/O
 - move local fs-specific stuff from MiscUtilities to FileVFS (UrlVFS
   calls getParentOfPath()?)
 - encoding option in VFS browser
 - when saving local files, save to .<filename>.save, then rename to
   <filename>
 - aborts not always fired
 - encoding option in VFS browser
 - Two-pane view in filesystem browser

+ ui
 - ensure find field doesn't get too large
 - finish persistent splits
 - The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.
 - use Dirk's VariableGridLayout more
 - escape in 'add abbrev' dialog
 - docked windows: discourage use of check box menu items, instead menu
   item calls addDockableWindow() and right click on tab shows menu with
   'Close'
 - fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
 - C+i in shortcuts editor
 - 'new view' creates incorrectly sized views due to Java bugs

+ beanshell
 - print() in BeanShell
 - actions.xml ACTIONS::ACTION attributes:
   NO_READ_ONLY, NO_DISCONT_SEL -- automatic error msg if read only or
   selection is discont.
 - improve handling of __char__
 - BeanShell class uses deprecated showFileDialog() method
 - runmacro= switch, nomacro switch

+ documentation
 - get rid of final blank page of user's guide
 - Migrate documentation to DocBook/XML
 - documentation: merge 'Text Registers' and 'The Clipboard' sections,
   also mention MMB in those sections. Merge 'Markers' and 'Position
   Registers'.
 - Include John's upcoming plugin guide

+ misc
 - site-props directory should be named 'properties'
