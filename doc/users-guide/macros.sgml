<chapter id=macros><title>Macros and Scripting</>
 <indexterm><primary>BeanShell</></indexterm>
 <para>
  A <firstterm>macro</> is a miniature program that can be
  run with a single menu item selection, keystroke, or tool bar
  click. Macros are useful for automating editing operations that would
  be very boring or tedious to perform by hand.
 </para>
 <para>
  Macros are written in the <firstterm>BeanShell</>
  scripting language.
  While this section will only cover basic uses of BeanShell, macros are
  by no means limited to what is described here; BeanShell is
  a complete programming language, and your imagination is the limit to
  what macros can do. A full description of BeanShell can be found at
  <ulink url="http://www.beanshell.org">http://www.beanshell.org</ulink>.
 </para>
 <sect1 id=macro-files><title>Macro Files</>
  <para>
   Macros are files with the extension <filename>.bsh</> and are stored in
   the <filename>macros</> subdirectory
   of the jEdit install directory and the <filename>macros</>
   subdirectory of the jEdit settings directory. The location of the
   settings directory is system-specific; see
   <xref linkend=settings-directory> for details.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>Macros menu</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Rescan Macros command</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Global Options command</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Utilities menu</></indexterm>
  <para>
   The <guimenu>Macros</> menu lists all known macros, in addition
   to commands for working with them. To play a macro, select it from
   the menu. A large macro collection can be organized into submenus
   by creating subdirectories inside the macro directories.
   The menu is automatically
   refreshed when macro files are created, deleted or renamed from within jEdit.
   Because macros are ordinary files, they can also be renamed and
   deleted with your operating system's file manager. The
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Rescan Macros</> command must be
   invoked to update the macros menu if changes are made in a program other
   than jEdit.
  </para>
  <para>
   Like most other menu item commands, macros can be assigned keyboard
   shortcuts and added to the right-click context menu or tool bar in
   the <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=macro-record><title>Recording Macros</>
  <indexterm><primary>Macros menu</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Record Macro command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Record Macro</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>R</></keycombo>) prompts for
   a macro name and begins recording.
   While recording is in progress, the string <quote>(macro recording)</> is
   displayed in the menu bar.
   jEdit records key strokes, commands invoked from
   the menu bar, tool bar clicks, and search and replace operations.
   Mouse clicks in the text area are <emphasis>not</> recorded; use
   the text selection commands or arrow keys when recording macros
   instead.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>Stop Recording command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Stop Recording</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>S</></keycombo>) stops recording.
   It also switches to the buffer containing the recorded macro,
   giving you a chance to check over the recorded commands
   and make any necessary changes. When you are happy with the macro,
   save the buffer and it will appear in the <guimenu>Macros</> menu.
   To discard the macro, close the buffer without saving.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=macro-temp><title>Temporary Macros</>
  <para>
   if a complicated operation only needs to be repeated a few of
   times, using the temporary macro feature is easier than saving a new
   macro file.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>Macros menu</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Record Temporary Macro command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Record Temporary Macro</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></keycombo>) begins recording
   to a buffer named <filename>Temporary_Macro.bsh</>.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>Stop Recording command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Stop Recording</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>S</></>) stops recording the
   temporary macro. This is the same command used to stop recording an
   ordinary macro.
   Once recording is complete, you don't need to save the
   <filename>Temporary_Macro.bsh</>
   buffer before playing it back--but if you do, it will become
   an ordinary macro, displayed in the <guimenu>Macros</> menu.
  </para>
  <indexterm><primary>Play Temporary Macro command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Macros</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Play Temporary Macro</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>M</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>P</></keycombo>) plays the
   macro recorded to the <filename>Temporary_Macro.bsh</> buffer.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=beanshell-expr><title>Evaluating BeanShell Expressions</>
  <indexterm><primary>Utilities menu</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Evaluate Selection command</></indexterm>
  <indexterm><primary>Evaluate command</></indexterm>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Evaluate BeanShell Expression</>
   prompts for a BeanShell expression, evaluates it, and displays the
   result in a dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Evaluate Selection</> evaluates
   the currently selected text, replacing it with the result.
  </para>
  <para>
   The possible uses for these two commands are endless; for example, they
   can be used to perform calculations. Try evaluating the following:

  <programlisting>Math.cos(Math.PI / 4) - 1 / Math.sqrt(2)</programlisting>
