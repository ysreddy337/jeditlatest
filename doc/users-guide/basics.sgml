  <para>
   Whenever a specific menu item selection is referenced, the
   top level menu is listed first, followed by successive levels of submenus,
   finally followed by the menu item itself. All menu components are separated
   by greater-than symbols (<quote>&gt;</>). For example,
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Scrolling</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Scroll
   to Current Line</> refers to the <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current Line</>
   command contained in the
   <guisubmenu>Scrolling</> submenu of the <guimenu>View</> menu.
  </para>
  <para>
   As with many other applications, menu items that end with
   ellipsis (...) display dialog boxes or windows when invoked.
   An additional jEdit-only convention is that menu items that end with
   <quote>[x]</quote> expect a character to be typed at the keyboard after
   being invoked.
  </para>
  <para>
   Many jEdit commands can be also be invoked using keystrokes. This speeds
   up editing by letting you keep your hands on the keyboard. Not all
   commands with keyboard shortcuts
   are accessible with one key stroke; for example, the
   keyboard shortcut for <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current Line</> is
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>J</></keycombo>. That is, you must first
   press <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>, followed by
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>J</></keycombo>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=starting><title>Starting jEdit</>
  <para>
   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   on Unix systems, usually you would
   run the <quote>jedit</quote> command at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   double click on the jEdit icon. Unless initial files to open were
   specified on the command line or dropped onto jEdit's icon, jEdit
   will load any files that were open in the previous editing session.
  </para>
  <para>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <firstterm>server</>, and subsequent invocations are known as
   <firstterm>clients</>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the <command>-background</> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. The advantage of background mode
   is that you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start up the first time. The downside of background
   mode is that jEdit will continue to consume memory when no windows
   are open.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <xref linkend=cli-usage>.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>The edit server and security</>
   <para>
    Not only does the server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <firstterm>authorization
    key</>; a randomly-generated number only accessable to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will <quote>bad guys</> have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </para>
   <para>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <command>-noserver</> command line switch.
   </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=buffers><title>Buffers</>
  <para>
   Several files can be opened and edited at once.
   Each open file is referred to as a <firstterm>buffer</>.
   The combo box above the text area selects the buffer to edit.
   Different emblems are displayed next to buffer names in the list,
   depending the buffer's state;
   a red disk is shown for buffers with unsaved changes,
   a lock is shown for read-only buffers,
   and a spark is shown for new buffers which don't yet exist on disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition to the buffer combo box, various commands can also be
   used to select the buffer to edit.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Previous Buffer</>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>Page Up</></>)
   switches to the previous buffer in the list.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Next Buffer</>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>Page Down</></>)
   switches to the next buffer in the list.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Recent Buffer</>
   (keyboard shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>`</></>)
   switches to the buffer that was being edited prior to the current one.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=views><title>Views</>
  <para>
   Each editor window is referred to as a <firstterm>view</>.
   It is possible to have multiple views open at once, and each view can
   be split into multiple panes.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>New View</> creates a new view.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Close View</> closes the
   current view. If only one view is open, closing it will exit jEdit,
   unless background mode is on; see <xref linkend=starting> for information
   about starting jEdit in background mode.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Splitting</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Split Horizontally</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>2</></keycombo>)
   splits the view into two text areas, above each other.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Splitting</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Split Vertically</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>3</></keycombo>)
   splits the view into two text areas, next to each other.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Splitting</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Unsplit</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>1</></keycombo>)
   removes all but the current text area from the view.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a view is split, editing commands operate on the text area that
   has keyboard focus. To give a text area keyboard focus, click in it
   with the mouse, or use the following commands.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Splitting</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to
   Previous Text Area</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</><keycap>Page Up</></keycombo>)
   shifts keyboard focus to the previous text area.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Splitting</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to
   Next Text Area</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Alt</><keycap>Page Down</></keycombo>)
   shifts keyboard focus to the next text area.
  </para>
  <para>
   Clicking the text area with the right mouse button displays a popup menu.
   Both this menu and the tool bar at the top of the view offer quick
   mouse-based access to frequently-used commands.
   The contents of the tool bar and right-click menu can be
   changed in the <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   The file system browser, HyperSearch results window, and many plugin
   windows can optionally be docked into the view. This can be
   configured in the <guibutton>Docking</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   When windows are docked into the view,
   the commands in the <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Docking</> menu
   (shortcuts: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycap>1</>, <keycap>2</>, <keycap>3</>, <keycap>4</>) can be used
   to show or hide the top, bottom, left and right docking areas,
   respectively. Double-clicking on the borders of docking areas has
   the same effect.

 <sect1 id=textarea><title>The Text Area</>
  <para>
   Text editing takes place in the text area. It behaves in a similar
   manner to many Windows and MacOS editors; the few
   unique features will be described in this section.
  </para>
  <para>
   The text area will automatically scroll up or down if the caret is moved
   closer than three lines to the first or last visible line. This
   feature is called <firstterm>electric scrolling</> and can be disabled
   in the <guibutton>Text Area</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   To aid in locating the caret, the current line is drawn with a
   different background color. To make it clear which lines end with
   white space, end of line markers are drawn at the end of each line.
   Both these features can be disabled in the <guibutton>Text Area</>
   pane of the <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   The column and line number
   containing the caret, as well as the total number of lines in the buffer,
   is shown in the bottom-left corner of the text area.
  </para>
  <para>
   The strip on the left of the text area is called a <firstterm>gutter</>.
   The gutter displays marker and register locations; it will also display
   line numbers if the 
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Line Numbers</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>T</></keycombo>) command is invoked.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=repeat><title>Command Repetition</>
  <para>
   To repeat a command any number of times, invoke
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Repeat Next Command</>
   (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>Enter</></keycombo>) and enter the
   desired repeat count, followed by the command to repeat (either a keystroke
   or menu item selection). For example,
   <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>Enter</></keycombo>
   <keycap>1</> <keycap>4</>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>D</></keycombo></quote> will delete
   14 lines, and <quote><keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>Enter</></keycombo>
   <keycap>8</>
   <keycap>#</></quote>
   will insert <quote>########</> in the buffer.
