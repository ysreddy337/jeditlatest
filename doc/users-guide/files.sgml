  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>New File</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>N</></>) opens a new untitled
   buffer. When it is saved, a file will be created on disk.
   Another way to create a new file is to specify a non-existent file
   name when starting jEdit from your operating system's command line.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=opening><title>Opening Files</>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Open File</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>O</></>) displays
   a file selector dialog box and loads the specified file into a new
   buffer. Multiple files to open can be selected by holding down
   <keycap>Control</>.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Insert File</> displays a file
   selector dialog box and inserts the specified file into the current
   buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Current
   Directory</> menu lists all files in the current buffer's directory.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Recent Files</> menu lists
   recent files. When a recent file is opened, the caret
   is automatically moved to its previous location in that file.
   The number of recent files to remember can be changed and caret
   position saving can be disabled in the <guibutton>General</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   Files that you do not have write access to are opened in read-only
   mode, and editing will not be permitted.

  <sidebar><title>GZipped Files</>
   <para>
    jEdit supports transparent editing of GZipped files; files with
    the <filename>.gz</> extension are automatically decompressed before
    loading, and compressed when saving.
   </para>

  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Save</> (shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>S</></keycombo>)
   saves the current buffer to disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Save All Buffers</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>S</></keycombo>) saves all open
   buffers to disk, asking for confirmation first.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Save As</> saves the buffer to a
   different specified file on disk. The buffer is then
   renamed, and subsequent saves also save to the specified file.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Save a Copy As</> saves the buffer to a
   different specified file on disk, but doesn't rename the
   buffer, and doesn't clear the <quote>modified</> flag.
  </para>
  <sect2><title>Autosave and Backups</>
   <para>
    The autosave feature protects your work from computer crashes and
    such. Every 30 seconds, all buffers with unsaved changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    (<quote>#</>) characters. For example, <filename>program.c</> will
    be autosaved to <filename>#program.c#</>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Saving a buffer using
    one of the commands in the previous section automatically deletes the
    autosave file, so they will only ever be visible in the unlikely
    event of a jEdit (or operating system) crash.
   </para>
   <para>
    If an autosave file is
    found while a buffer is being loaded, jEdit will offer to recover the
    autosaved data.
   </para>
   <!-- <figure><title>Dialog box shown if a file has autosaved changes</>
    <graphic fileref=dialog-autosave scale=50></>
   </figure> -->
   <para>
    The backup feature can be used to roll back to the previous version
    of a file after changes were made. When a buffer is saved
    for the first time after being opened, its original contents are
    preserved in the buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde (<quote>~</>).
    For example, <filename>paper.tex</> will be backed up to
    <filename>paper.tex~</>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The autosave and backup features can be configured
    in the <guibutton>Loading and Saving</> pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2><title>Line Separators</>
   <para>
    The three major operating systems use different conventions to mark
    line endings in text files.
    The MacOS uses Carriage-Return characters (\r, ^M) for that purpose. Unix
    uses Newline characters (\n, ^J). Windows uses both
    (\r\n, ^M^J). jEdit can read and write files in all three formats.
    When a file is opened, the line separator is automatically
    detected. The line separator can be set on a buffer-specific basis
    in the <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Buffer Options</> dialog box.
    The default for new files can be set in the
    <guibutton>Loading and Saving</> pane of the
    <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=vfs-browser><title>The File System Browser</>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>File System Browser</> displays a
   file system browser window.
   By default, the file system browser is shown in a floating window;
   it can be set to dock into the view in the <guibutton>Docking</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   The directory path to view is specified in the <guibutton>Path</> text
   field. A subset of the current directory to display can be specified in the
   form of a glob pattern in the <guibutton>Filter</> text field.
   See <xref linkend=globs> for information about glob patterns.
   Pressing the <keycap>Up</> and <keycap>Down</> keys in both text
   fields recalls previously entered strings; see <xref linkend=history>
   for details.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can view an entire directory hierarchy at once by clicking
   the expander controls next to directories in the tree.
  </para>
  <para>
   The toolbar buttons perform the following actions, from left to right:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><guibutton>Up</> - displays the current
   directory's parent in the file system view. The popup arrow next to
   this button displays a
   menu listing all the parent directories of the current directory,
   up to the filesystem root</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guibutton>Reload</> - reloads the file list
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guibutton>Local Drives</> - displays all
   local drives. On Windows, this will be a list of
   drive letters; on Unix, the list will only contain one entry, the
   root directory</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guibutton>Home Directory</> - displays your
   home directory in the file system browser</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guibutton>Parent Directory of Current Buffer</> -
   displays the directory containing the current buffer
   in the file system browser</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Clicking the <guimenu>More</> button displays a menu containing
   several less frequently-used commands:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Show Hidden Files</> - a check box menu
   item that controls if hidden
   files will be shown in the file list</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guimenuitem>New Directory</> - creates a new
   directory, prompting for the desired name
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Add to Favorites</> - adds the currently
   selected (or the currently displayed, if there is nothing
   selected) directory to the favorites list</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Go to Favorites</> - displays the favorites
   list. To remove a directory from the list, right-click on it and select
   <guimenuitem>Delete</> from the resulting popup menu</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Right-clicking on a file in the file system browser displays a popup menu,
   containing commands for manipulating that file, in addition to all the
   commands from the <guibutton>More</> menu.
   If the file is already open, the popup will have commands to
   display it in the current view, display it in a new view, or close it.
   Unopened file popups have commands for opening, deleting and renaming.
   Note that attempting to delete a directory containing files
   will give an error;
   only empty directories may be deleted.
  </para>
  <para>
   The file system browser can be navigated from the keyboard:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><keycap>Enter</> - opens the currently selected file or
   directory</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><keycap>Left</> - goes to the current directory's parent
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><keycap>Up</> - selects previous file in list
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para><keycap>Down</> - selects next file in list
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>Typing the first few characters of
   a file's name will select that file
   </para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   The file system view must have keyboard focus for these keys
   to work. In the <guimenuitem>Open File</> dialog box, it is given
   keyboard focus by default. In other instances, it can be given
   keyboard focus by clicking with the mouse.
  </para>
  <para>
   The file system browser can be customized in the <guibutton>File
   System Browser</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=reloading><title>Reloading Files</>
  <para>
   If an open buffer is modified on disk by another application, a warning
   dialog box is displayed, offering to either continue editing
   (and lose changes made by the other application)
   or reload the buffer from disk (and lose any usaved changes). This
   feature can be disabled in the <guibutton>General</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Reload</> can be used to discard
   unsaved changes and reload the current buffer from disk at any other
   time; a confirmation dialog box will be displayed first if the buffer
   has unsaved changes.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Reload All Buffers</> discards
   unsaved changes in all open buffers and reload them from disk,
   asking for confirmation first.
  </para>

 <sect1 id=threaded-io><title>Multi-Threaded I/O</>
  <para>
   To improve responsiveness and perceived performance,
   jEdit executes all input/output operations asynchronously.
   While I/O is in progress, a small disk icon is displayed in the menu bar,
   in addition to progress meters for each running operation.
   The <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>I/O Progress Monitor</> command
   displays a window with more detailed status information. Requests
   can also be aborted in this window. Note that aborting a buffer save can
   result in data loss.
  </para>
  <para>
   By default, four I/O threads are created, which means that up
   to four buffers can be loaded or saved simultaneously. The number of
   threads can be changed in the
   <guibutton>Loading and Saving</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
   Setting the number to zero disables multi-threaded I/O completely; doing
   this is not recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Print</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>P</></keycombo>)
   will print the current buffer. By default, the printed output will have
   syntax highlighting, and each page will have a header with the file name,
   and a footer with the current date/time and page number. The appearance of
   printed output
   can be customized in the <guibutton>Printing</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global
   Options</> dialog box.
  </para>

  <para>
   <guimenu>File</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Close Buffer</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>W</></keycombo>)
   closes the current buffer. If it has unsaved changes, jEdit
   will ask if they should be saved first.
  </para>
  <!-- <figure><title>The message displayed if a file has unsaved changes</>
   <graphic scale=50 fileref=dialog-unsaved></>

   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>W</></keycombo>)
   closes all buffers. If any buffers have unsaved
   changes, they will be listed in a dialog box where they can be saved
   or discarded. In the dialog box, multiple buffers to operate on at
   once can be selected by clicking on them in the list while holding
   down <keycap>Control</>.
  </para>
