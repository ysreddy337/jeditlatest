<chapter id=source-edit><title>Editing Source Code</>
 <sect1 id=abbrevs><title>Abbreviations</>
  <para>
   Using abbreviations reduces the time spent typing long but commonly used
   strings. For example, in Java mode, the abbreviation <quote>sout</> is
   defined to expand to <quote>System.out.println()</>, so to insert
   <quote>System.out.println()</> in a Java buffer, you only need to type
   <quote>sout</> followed by
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>;</></keycombo>.
   Each abbreviation can either be global, in which case it will expand in all
   edit modes, or mode-specific. Abbreviations can be edited
   in the <guibutton>Abbrevs</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand Abbreviation</> (keyboard
   shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>;</></keycombo>)
   attempts to expand the word before the caret. If no expansion could
   be found, it will offer to define one.
  </para>
  <!-- <para>
   The string <quote>\n</> in an abbreviation expansion inserts a newline,
   <quote>\t</> inserts a tab. The caret is located at
   the position of the string <quote>\|</>. The <quote>\|</> will
   not appear in the buffer. For example, if
   <quote>il</> is defined to expand to
   <quote>SwingUtilities.invokeLater(\|);</>,
   the text <quote>SwingUtilities.invokeLater();</> will be inserted
   in the buffer, with the caret positioned between the brackets.
  </para> -->

  <para>
   Automatic abbreviation expansion can be enabled in the
   <guibutton>Abbrevs</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
   If enabled, pressing the space bar will automatically expand
   the word before the caret, assuming it is a valid abbreviation.
  </para>

   If automatic expansion
   is enabled, a space can be inserted without expanding the word before

 <sect1 id=bracket-matching><title>Bracket Matching</>
  <para>
   Misplaced and unmatched brackets are one of the most common syntax
   errors encountered when writing code. jEdit has several features
   to make brackets easier to deal with.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the character immediately before the caret position is a bracket, the
   matching one will be highlighted (assuming it is visible on the
   screen). Bracket highlighting can be disabled in the
   <guibutton>Text Area</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Matching
   Bracket</> (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>]</></keycombo>)
   goes to the bracket matching the one before the caret.
  </para>
  <para>
   Double-clicking on a bracket in the text area will select all text
   between the bracket and the one matching it.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Select Code Block</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>[</></keycombo>)
   selects all text between the two brackets nearest to the caret.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Previous
   Bracket</> (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></>
   <keycap>[</>)
   moves the caret to the previous opening bracket.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Go to Next
   Bracket</> (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></>
   <keycap>]</>)
   moves the caret to the next closing bracket.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    jEdit's bracket matching algorithm only checks syntax tokens with the same
    type as the original bracket for matches. So brackets inside string
    literals and comments will not cause problems, as they will
    be skipped.

 <sect1 id=indent><title>Tabbing and Indentation</>
  <para>
   jEdit makes a distinction between the <firstterm>tab width</>, which is
   is used when displaying tab characters, and the <firstterm>indent width</>,
   which is used when a level of indent is to be added or removed, for example
   by mode-specific smart indent routines. Both can be changed in one of
   several ways:

  </para>
  <sect2 id=soft-tabs><title>Soft Tabs</>
   <para>
    Because files indented using tab characters may look less than ideal when
    viewed on a system with a different default tab size, it is sometimes
    desirable to use multiple spaces, known as <firstterm>soft tabs</>,
    instead of real tab characters, to indent code.
   </para>

    Soft tabs can be enabled or disabled in one of several ways:

    The auto indent feature inserts the appropriate number of tabs or
    spaces at the beginning of a line.
   </para>
   <para>
    If indent on enter is enabled, pressing <keycap>Enter</>
    will create a new line with the appropriate amount of
    indent automatically.  If indent on tab is enabled, pressing

    an unindented line will insert the appropriate amount of
    indentation. Pressing it again will insert a tab character.

   <para>
    Auto indent behavior is mode-specific. In most edit modes,
    the indent of the previous line is simply copied over.
    However, in C-like languages (C, C++, Java, JavaScript), curly
    brackets and language statements are taken into account and indent
    is added and removed as necessary.

    indents all selected lines, or the current line if there is no
    selection.
   </para>

    To insert a literal tab or newline without performing
    indentation, prefix the tab or newline with
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
    <keycap>V</>. For example,
    to create a new line without any indentation, type

 <sect1 id=commenting><title>Commenting Out Code</>
  <para>
   Most programming and markup languages support <quote>comments</>, or
   regions of  code which are ignored by the compiler/interpreter. jEdit
   has commands which make inserting comments more convenient.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Wing Comment</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>C</></keycombo>) encloses the
   selection with comment start and end strings. An example of Java
   wing commented code looks like so:
  </para>
  <screen>/* if(obj instanceof DBConnection)
    ((DBConnection)obj).close(); */</screen>
  <para>
   Comment start and end strings can be changed on a mode-specific
   basis in the
   <guibutton>Mode-Specific</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box, or on a buffer-specific basis using buffer-local
   properties. For example, placing the following in one of the first 10 lines
   of a buffer will change the wing comment strings to <quote>(*</> and
   <quote>*)</>:
  </para>
  <screen>:commentStart=(*:commentEnd=*):</screen>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Box Comment</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>B</></keycombo>) encloses the
   selection with comment start and end strings, and places the box
   comment string at the start of each line. An example of Java
   box commented code looks like so:
  </para>
  <screen>/* if(obj instanceof DBConnection)
*     ((DBConnection)obj).close(); */</screen>
  <para>
   The strings used for box commenting can be changed on a mode-specific
   basis in the <guibutton>Mode-Specific</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box, or on a buffer-specific basis using buffer-local
   properties. For example, placing the following in one of the first 10 lines
   of a buffer will change the box comment strings to <quote>(*</> and
   <quote>*</>), with <quote>**</> placed at the start of each line:
  </para>
  <screen>:commentStart=(*:commentEnd=*):boxComment=**:</screen>
  <para>
   <guimenu>Edit</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Source Code</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Block Comment</>
   (shortcut: <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>K</></keycombo>) inserts the
   block comment string at the start of each selected line.
   An example of Java block commented code looks like so:
  </para>
  <screen>// if(obj instanceof DBConnection)
//     ((DBConnection)obj).close();</screen>
  <para>
   The block comment string can be changed on a mode-specific
   basis in the <guibutton>Mode-Specific</> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</>
   dialog box, or on a buffer-specific basis using buffer-local
   properties. For example, placing the following in one of the first 10 lines
   of a buffer will change the block comment string to <quote>#</>:
  </para>
  <screen>:blockComment=#:</screen>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id=folding><title>Folding</>
  <para>
   The folding feature allows lines to be hidden or shown, depending on their
   indent level. Since most programming languages use indentation to nest
   code, folding away lines with a lot of indent has the effect of displaying
   an <quote>overview</> of the buffer only, while displaying
   higher indent levels <quote>zooms in</> on the code
   and shows more <quote>detail</>.
  </para>
  <para>
   A set of consecutive lines with the same leading indent is referred to as
   a <firstterm>fold</>. The visibility of each fold can be set independently.
   Text hidden by folding is still present in the buffer, and can be made
   visible again using the appropriate commands. Cursor movement commands
   skip over the hidden text, but text manipulation commands act on it.
  </para>
  <para>
   The initial fold visibility level, in multiples of the current tab size,
   can be specified on a mode-specific or global basis in the
   <guimenu>Utilities</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</> dialog box. Folds
   with a level higher than this will be automatically collapsed after a buffer
   is loaded. Setting this value to zero makes all folds expanded initially
   (this is the default).
  </para>
  <para>
   The simplest way to expand and collapse folds is to click the fold markers
   in the gutter to the left of the text area; a fold marker is drawn next to
   the first line of each fold. An empty square is drawn next to an
   expanded fold; a filled square next to a collapsed fold. Unless the
   <keycap>Shift</> key is held down, clicking a filled square will expand
   the fold by one level only; nested folds will remain collapsed. Holding down
   <keycap>Shift</> while clicking will filly expand the fold and all nested
   folds.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Collapse
   Fold</> (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Alt</><keycap>Backspace</></keycombo>) collapses the fold
   containing the caret.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand
   Fold One Level</> (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Alt</><keycap>Enter</></keycombo>) expands the fold
   containing the caret. Nested folds will remain collapsed.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand
   Fold Fully</> (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Alt</><keycap>Shift</><keycap>Enter</></keycombo>)
   expands the fold
   containing the caret, also expanding any nested folds.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand All
   Folds</> (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo> <keycap>Enter</>)
   reads the next character entered at the keyboard, and expands all folds
   in the buffer
   with a fold level less than that specified, and collapsed all others.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand All
   Folds</> (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo> <keycap>X</>)
   expands all folds in the buffer.
  </para>
  <para>
   <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Select Fold</>
   (keyboard shortcut:
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo> <keycap>S</>)
   selects all lines in the fold containing the caret. Control-clicking on a
   fold marker in the gutter on the left of the text area has the same effect.
  </para>
  <para>
   Because folding is based on indent levels, changing the leading indent of a
   line while folds are collapsed may result in portions of the buffer becoming
   temporarily inaccessable. In such a case, simply invoke <guimenuitem>Expand
   All Folds</> to restore the visibility of the hidden lines.
  </para>
  <sect2 id=narrowing><title>Narrowing</>
   <para>
    The narrowing feature hides all parts of the buffer except for one
    specified region. While that region appears to be all there is, the
    rest of the text is still in the buffer; just not visible.
    While it may seem unrelated to folding, both folding and
    narrowing are implemented using the same code internally.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Narrow Buffer to
    Selection</> (keyboard shortcut:
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo> <keycap>N</>)
    hides all lines the buffer except those in the selection.
   </para>
   <para>
    <guimenu>View</>&gt;<guisubmenu>Folding</>&gt;<guimenuitem>Expand All
    Folds</> (keyboard shortcut:
    <keycombo><keycap>Control</><keycap>E</></keycombo> <keycap>X</>)
    will make visible any lines
    hidden by narrowing.
