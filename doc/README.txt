* About jEdit

jEdit is an Open Source, cross platform text editor written in Java. It
has many advanced features that make text editing easier, such as syntax
highlighting, auto indent, abbreviation expansion, registers, macros,
regular expressions, and multiple file search and replace.

jEdit requires either Java 1.1 with Swing 1.1, or Java 2 to work.

jEdit is released under the _GNU General Public License_, which can be
found in the COPYING.txt file. jEdit comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND; see section 11 and 12 of the GPL for details.

* jEdit on the Internet

The jEdit homepage, located at <http://jedit.sourceforge.net> contains
the latest version of jEdit, along with plugin downloads.

There are three mailing lists dedicated to jEdit; an announcement
list that is very low traffic, a general discussion list, and a
development discussion list. To subscribe, unsubscribe or view list
archives, visit <http://www.sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=588>.

The preferred way to report bugs is to use our bug tracker;
<http://www.sourceforge.net/bugs/?groups_id=588>. When writing a bug
report, please try to be as specific as possible. You should specify
your jEdit version, Java version, operating system, any relevant output
from the activity log, and an e-mail address, in case we need further
information to fix the bug.

The preferred way to suggest features is to post a message to the
jEdit-users or jEdit-devel mailing list.

If you would like to discuss the BeanShell scripting language,
subscribe to one of the BeanShell mailing lists by visiting
<http://www.beanshell.org/contact.html>.

Finally, you may contact me directly by e-mailing <sp@gjt.org>.

* Documentation

An HTML version of the jEdit user's guide is included with jEdit; to
view it, invoke `Help->jEdit User Guide' from jEdit's menu bar, or open
`doc/users-guide/index.html' in a WWW browser such as Netscape.

A PDF version can be obtained from <http://jedit.sourceforge.net>. It
can be viewed in a PDF viewer such as Adobe Acrobat.

* Common problems

Before reporting a problem with jEdit, please make sure it is not
actually a Java bug, or a well-known problem.

- If you get an OutOfMemoryError while editing a large file, even if
  your computer has a large amount of RAM present, increase the Java
  heap size.

  - On Windows, edit the `jEdit.bat' file and change the line that looks
    like so:

    set JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=16

  - On Unix, edit the `jedit' shell script and change the line that
    looks like so:

    JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=16

  In both cases, replace `16' with the desired heap size, in megabytes.
  For best results, use a heap size of about 2.5 times the largest file
  size you plan to edit.

- You must rebuild the mode cache with the `Utilities->Reload Edit Modes'
  command after adding or removing edit modes, otherwise jEdit will not
  notice the changes. Note that the mode cache is automatically rebuilt
  after a new jEdit version is installed.

- Printing doesn't work very well, especially on Java 2. There isn't
  much I can do about this until Sun fixes several outstanding bugs in
  Java.

- International keyboards, input methods, composed keys, etc. might not
  work properly. As I do not have an international keyboard, this will
  likely remain unfixed until someone submits the necessary code.

- The Swing HTML component used by jEdit's help viewer is very buggy.
  Although the jEdit online help works around many of the bugs, it still
  renders some HTML incorrectly and runs very slowly.

- On Unix, saving a file will reset its permissions to the defaults if
  backups are enabled. There is no easy way to fix this. The only
  workaround is to disable backups in Utilities->Global Options.

- On Unix systems with X Windows, you might not be able to copy and
  paste between jEdit and other programs. This is mainly because Java
  can only access the system clipboard, and not the primary selection
  (which some programs use instead of the clipboard). The XClipboard
  plugin available from <http://jedit.standmed.com> solves part of the
  problem by allowing read-only access to the primary selection.

- Because jEdit is written in Java, it will always be slower than a
  native application. The performance gap can be narrowed by installing
  a good virtual machine and just in time compiler.

* Problems that occur with older Java versions

- If you are having problems such as Alt-key mnemonics not working, or
  keystrokes inserting garbage into the text area, make sure you are
  running the very latest Java version for your platform. Some older
  Java versions, especially on Linux, had buggy key handling.

- If you are using Java 1.1 and get a `ClassNotFoundException:
  javax/swing/JWindow' or similar exception when starting jEdit,
  chances are you don't have Swing installed properly. Download Swing
  from <http://java.sun.com/products/jfc>. Alternatively, upgrade to
  Java 2, which doesn't require you to install Swing separately.

* Libraries

jEdit depends on, and comes bundled with the following libraries:

- gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. This is used to implement
  regular expression search and replace, among other things. gnu.regexp
  is released under the _GNU Lesser General Public License_. The version
  included with jEdit differs slightly from the latest official version.
  The original can be found at <http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/>.

- AElfred XML parser by Microstar corporation. This is used by the
  syntax highlighting code to parse mode files. This class library is
  released under its own, non-GPL license, which reads as follows:

  "AElfred is free for both commercial and non-commercial use and
  redistribution, provided that Microstar's copyright and disclaimer are
  retained intact.  You are free to modify AElfred for your own use and
  to redistribute AElfred with your modifications, provided that the
  modifications are clearly documented."

  The complete AElfred package is located at <http://www.microstar.com>.

- BeanShell scripting language, by Pat Niemeyer. This is used to
  implement macros, among other things. The version included with jEdit
  is basically a stripped down BeanShell 1.01, with a few minor changes.
  The original package is located at <http://www.beanshell.org>.

- The Sun Java look and Feel icon collection. The license may be found
  in the ICONS.LICENSE.txt file.
