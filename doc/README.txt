* About jEdit

jEdit is a cross platform text editor written in Java. It has many
advanced features that make text editing easier, such as syntax
highlighting, auto indent, abbreviation expansion, registers, macros,
folding, regular expressions, and multiple file search and replace.

jEdit is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under the
terms of the GNU General Public License. See the file COPYING.txt for
details.

jEdit requires Java 2 (or Java 1.1 with Swing 1.1) in order to work.

* jEdit on the Internet

The jEdit homepage, located at <http://www.jedit.org> contains the
latest version of jEdit, along with plugin downloads.

There are three mailing lists dedicated to jEdit; an announcement
list that is very low traffic, a general discussion list, and a
development discussion list. To subscribe, unsubscribe or view list
archives, visit <http://www.sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=588>.

If you would like to discuss the BeanShell scripting language,
subscribe to one of the BeanShell mailing lists by visiting
<http://www.beanshell.org/contact.html>.

Finally, you may contact me directly by e-mailing <slava@jedit.org>.

* Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, please read the `Common Problems' section below.
If that doesn't answer your question, report a bug with our bug tracker;
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=588&atid=100588>. When writing
a bug report, please try to be as specific as possible. You should
specify your jEdit version, Java version, operating system, any relevant
output from the activity log, and an e-mail address, in case we need
further information to fix the bug.

* Suggesting features

The preferred way to suggest features is to post a message to the
jEdit-users or jEdit-devel mailing list.

* Documentation

An HTML version of the jEdit user's guide is included with jEdit; to
view it, invoke `Help->jEdit User Guide' from jEdit's menu bar, or open
`doc/users-guide/index.html' in a WWW browser such as Netscape.

A PDF version can be obtained from <http://www.jedit.org>. It can be
viewed in a PDF viewer such as Adobe Acrobat.

* Common problems

Before reporting a problem with jEdit, please make sure it is not
actually a Java bug, or a well-known problem.

- If you get an OutOfMemoryError while editing a large file, even if
  your computer has a large amount of RAM present, increase the Java
  heap size.

  - On Windows, edit the `jEdit.bat' file and change the line that looks
    like so:

    set JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=32

  - On Unix, edit the `jedit' shell script and change the line that
    looks like so:

    JAVA_HEAP_SIZE=32

  In both cases, replace `32' with the desired heap size, in megabytes.
  For best results, use a heap size of about 2.5 times the largest file
  size you plan to edit.

- Printing doesn't work very well, especially on Java 2. There isn't
  much I can do about this until Sun fixes several outstanding bugs in
  Java.

- Aborting I/O operations in the I/O Progress Monitor doesn't always
  work.

- Edit modes you write will not be available in the editor until you add
  an entry to the `catalog' file in the appropriate modes directory.

- International keyboards, input methods, composed keys, etc. might not
  work properly. As I do not have an international keyboard, this will
  likely remain unfixed until someone submits the necessary code.

- The Swing HTML component used by jEdit's help viewer is very buggy.
  Although the jEdit online help works around many of the bugs, it still
  renders some HTML incorrectly and runs very slowly.

- On Unix systems with X Windows, you might not be able to copy and
  paste between jEdit and other programs. This is mainly because Java
  can only access the system clipboard, and not the primary selection
  (which some programs use instead of the clipboard). The XClipboard
  plugin available from <http://plugins.jedit.org> solves part of the
  problem by allowing read-only access to the primary selection.

- Because jEdit is written in Java, it will always be slower than a
  native application. The performance gap can be narrowed by installing
  a good virtual machine and just in time compiler.

* Problems that occur with older Java versions

- If you are having problems such as Alt-key mnemonics not working, or
  keystrokes inserting garbage into the text area, make sure you are
  running the very latest Java version for your platform. Some older
  Java versions, especially on Linux, had buggy key handling.

- If you are using Java 1.1 and get a `ClassNotFoundException:
  javax/swing/JWindow' or similar exception when starting jEdit,
  chances are you don't have Swing installed properly. Download Swing
  from <http://java.sun.com/products/jfc>. Alternatively, upgrade to
  Java 2, which doesn't require you to install Swing separately.

* Libraries

jEdit depends on, and comes bundled with the following libraries:

- gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. This is used to implement
  regular expression search and replace, among other things.

  The gnu.regexp homepage is <http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/>.

- AElfred XML parser by Microstar corporation. This is used by the
  syntax highlighting code to parse mode files. This class library is
  released under its own, non-GPL license, which reads as follows:

  "AElfred is free for both commercial and non-commercial use and
  redistribution, provided that Microstar's copyright and disclaimer are
  retained intact.  You are free to modify AElfred for your own use and
  to redistribute AElfred with your modifications, provided that the
  modifications are clearly documented."

  The AElfred home page is <http://www.microstar.com>.

- BeanShell scripting language, by Pat Niemeyer. This is used to
  implement macros, among other things. The version included with jEdit
  is basically a stripped down BeanShell 1.01, with a few minor changes.

  The BeanShell homepage is <http://www.beanshell.org>.

- The Sun Java look and Feel icon collection. The license may be found
  in the ICONS.LICENSE.txt file.
